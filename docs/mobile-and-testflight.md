# Mobile apps & TestFlight — how the iOS builds work

The single reference for how the Beau Access Solutions iOS apps are built and how
an edit reaches testers. Written 2026-07-14 after a status pass found the tracker
badly out of date on this (it treated TestFlight as unstarted; all three apps are
live on it). See [TRACKER.md §2b](../TRACKER.md).

## The three TestFlight apps

| TestFlight name | App | Build type | Source repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Access Atlas** | Access Atlas | Capacitor / WKWebView **wrapper** | `access-directory` (`capacitor.config.ts`) |
| **KindredAccess** | KindredAccess | Capacitor / WKWebView **wrapper** | `kindredaccess-ios` ⚠️ *no remote* |
| **Baseline** | Chronic Illness Tracker (CIT) | **native Expo / React Native** (EAS) | `bas-apps/apps/cit` ⚠️ *no remote* |

> **CIT ships as "Baseline" on TestFlight.** If you're looking for CIT in App Store
> Connect / TestFlight, it's under that name.

## Two very different architectures

### 1. Webview wrappers (Access Atlas, KindredAccess)

A thin native binary whose only job is to load a **hosted website** in a
WKWebView at runtime (`capacitor.config.ts` → `server.url`). The "app" is really
the live site.

- **Access Atlas** loads `https://access-atlas-qd464.ondigitalocean.app`
- **KindredAccess** loads `https://kindredaccess.org`

**Consequence:** a code/content edit ships by **redeploying the web app**, NOT by
rebuilding for TestFlight. A tester sees it on next launch (force-quit to clear
the WKWebView cache). You only need a **new TestFlight build** when the *native
shell* changes: app icon, splash, `server.url`, native plugins, or a version bump
for a fresh review round.

### 2. Native Expo app (Baseline / CIT)

`bas-apps/apps/cit` is a real React Native app (Expo, EAS-built, bundle
`com.beauaccesssolutions.cit`). It renders native screens and calls the CIT API
backend (`EXPO_PUBLIC_CIT_API_URL` → `https://chronic-illness-tracker-7o7fw.ondigitalocean.app/api`),
authenticating via prod Keycloak (`https://id.kindredaccess.org/realms/bas`).

**Consequence:** its own code edits do **not** auto-appear. Two paths:

| Change | How it ships | New TestFlight build? |
|---|---|---|
| JS/TS only (screens, logic), native runtime unchanged | `eas update --channel production` (OTA) | **No** — testers get it on next launch |
| Native (new modules, permissions, `runtimeVersion` bump, icons) | `eas build` + `eas submit` | **Yes** |

A **server-side backend fix** reaches Baseline only through the API it calls, and
only for features the native app actually has. (Example: the 2026-07-14 AI
date-range fix is in the CIT *backend*; Baseline has **no AI-insights screen yet**,
so it's a no-op there until that screen is ported.)

## "I made an edit — how do I get it in front of testers?"

1. **Which app?**
   - Access Atlas / KindredAccess → it's a wrapper. **Deploy the web app** (below). Done. No build.
   - Baseline (CIT) → native. JS-only change → `eas update`. Native change → `eas build` + `eas submit`.
2. **Web deploy triggers:**
   - **Access Atlas** — `deploy_on_push: true` on `main` (auto). Merge → live in minutes → relaunch app.
   - **CIT backend** — `deploy_on_push: true` on `main` (auto).
   - **KindredAccess** — **manual SSH** to the DO Droplet. `main` edits do **not** reach `kindredaccess.org` (or the app) until someone redeploys.
   - **Keycloak** (`id.kindredaccess.org`) — manual.
3. **Cache:** if a wrapper shows stale content, force-quit and reopen (WKWebView cache).

## Known gotchas

- **External TestFlight review, Access Atlas:** a bare webview wrapper is rejected
  under App Store **Guideline 4.2**. Internal TestFlight (≤100 testers) is fine.
  Clearing external review needs the camera evidence-photo feature
  (`access-directory` iOS runbook).
- **Mobile source is unbacked (⚠️):** `bas-apps`, `kindredaccess-ios`,
  `bas-frontend`, and `access-atlas-mobile` have **no git remote** — local-only,
  lost if the machine dies. Push them (naming/visibility is a call to make, like
  a11y-probe). Tracked in [TRACKER.md §6](../TRACKER.md).
- **`access-atlas-mobile` is abandoned** — a separate Expo attempt with a single
  "Initial commit". The real Access Atlas TestFlight build is the Capacitor
  wrapper in `access-directory`, not this.
- **Disability Wiki — native spike, NOT on TestFlight yet.** `disability-wiki`
  (Astro Starlight member app, remote `Beaudoin0zach/disability-wiki`) has an
  early Capacitor spike (`app/capacitor.config.json`, branch `spike/capacitor-native`).
  When it ships it'll be a fourth webview wrapper; today it's not a TestFlight
  build. Tracked in its §1 onboarding row.
